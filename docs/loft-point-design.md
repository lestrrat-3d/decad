# Point-section loft

`Document.LoftFromPoint(ctx, apex, sketch, profile)` builds the cone over one
authenticated, closed Sketch region. The point is a world coordinate in
millimetres. The region keeps its recorded segment kinds and exact Sketch trim
ranges. The method accepts a single outer loop and refuses holes: coning every
hole loop to the same point would give the apex a non-disk vertex link.

The apex must lie off the profile plane. The evaluator keeps one apex vertex,
one far vertex per certified chord station, one wall triangle per station
interval, and a triangulated far cap. It checks the held triangles for
crossings, then orients the complete shell by its signed volume. Wall faces
carry `side(0,j)` roles for the original segment `j`; the cap carries
`capEnd`. The body records the original profile and plane beside the
held mesh, so placement and later consumers can identify the source curve.
No small profile stands in for the point.

The profile passes the ordinary Sketch seam and area falsifier. The existing
Loft station rules chord each recorded segment against its own certified
bound. A sampled loop whose non-adjacent chord tubes overlap is refused before
construction. The body refuses a cap triangulation or a fan that collapses.

For each wall cell, the source boundary lies within its certified chord
departure of the held far chord. Linear interpolation from the common apex
scales this departure by at most one, so the same bound covers the whole fan.
The cap's region difference is bounded by the section displacement area tube.
Its cone has at most the distance from the apex to the plane origin times that
area, divided by three, in occupied-volume difference. A separate swept-mesh
term covers rounding of the held far vertices. The area proof adds the cap
region difference and an upper bound on both the true and held wall areas.
Every mesh facet retains a source face role; `VerifyAll` checks the closed
boundary and publishes the finite occupied-volume allowance.

The result has the ordinary `BodySolid` readings and faceted restatement.
It accepts placement through the faceted payload. A chord tolerance below its
held mesh bound is `ErrUnsupported`; the caller may use a larger tolerance.
This first point-section form has no holes, section alignment or surface
result option.
